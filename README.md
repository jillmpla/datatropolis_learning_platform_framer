# 📚 Learning Platform (Datatropolis - Data City) - Framer Prototype

This repository documents the **Learning Platform (Datatropolis - Data City)** prototype, designed and built with [Framer](https://www.framer.com/).  

The project explores how a gamified approach can make data science concepts more engaging, combining **urban planning themes** with structured learning modules, interactive quizzes, and applied data challenges.  

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://maroon-menu-830795.framer.app/)**  

> 📌 This prototype demonstrates how **gamification, interactivity, and UX design** can transform complex subjects like data science into engaging learning experiences.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Prototype

- **Educational Modules** – Structured lessons that guide users through data science concepts  
- **Interactive Quizzes** – Reinforce learning and provide instant feedback  
- **Practical Challenges** – Real-world tasks that allow users to apply knowledge  
- **Gamified Dashboard** – A city-building theme ties learning progress to visual growth  

---

## 🛠️ Development Process

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes** – sketched user flows and layouts to establish structure  
- **High-Fidelity Prototyping** – used Framer’s grid, stack, and interactive components to design a detailed, functional experience  
- **Interactivity & Animation** – dropdowns, slideshows, quizzes with reset options, and chart generation for data challenges  
- **User Testing** – in-person usability testing with participants, gathering feedback on clarity, navigation, and interactive elements

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Homepage Dashboard** – cards for modules, quizzes, and challenges with progress tracking  
- **Modules Page** – dropdown lessons with slideshows and knowledge checks  
- **Quizzes** – card-based quizzes with instant feedback and reset functionality  
- **Data Challenges** – user inputs generate a chart with option to download; confirmation via modal window  
- **Global Navigation** – consistent header and bottom navigation for clarity and usability  

---

## 🧱 Design Patterns & System Thinking
- **Cards** for organizing content consistently across dashboard, quizzes, and challenges  
- **Stacks & Grids** for responsive layouts, scalable to future lessons and quizzes  
- **Reusable Components** – dropdowns, quiz cards, and modal windows built once and applied across multiple flows  

---

## 👥 User Testing & Insights

- Participants navigated modules and quizzes smoothly, confirming intuitive design.
- The **reset feature** in quizzes was seen as highly useful and should be applied more broadly  
- Some learners needed clearer visual cues for key information, such as better highlighting of mistakes in knowledge checks and simpler data input in challenges.
- Lessons learned: reinforce feedback cues, refine guidance, and improve discoverability of interactive elements

## 📊 Fidelity & Design Decisions

- **Information Design** – Very High Fidelity: consistent layouts, responsive grids, clear organization  
- **Interaction Design** – High Fidelity: custom interactive components, but could expand with code overrides  
- **Visual Branding** – Very High Fidelity: cohesive theme (urban planning + data science), logo, color palette, consistent typography  
- **Editorial Content** – Very High Fidelity: no filler text; real lessons, quizzes, and challenges
